Hiiiiii

This is a web version of Ranked Analysis Tool: (https://github.com/NotE4sy/Ranked-Analysis-Tool) but with a bit more features

Like RAT, this is a tool to check a player's average splits, timestamps and death rates for their past x <= 50 matches, including overworld and bastion splits death rates

This was made with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS as a project to learn web development

To run this project locally, you will need nodejs install onto your computer in order to run a nodejs server

To run a nodejs server, run: ```npx serve . --single``` in terminal
